## 📝 Project Summary

The quantum algorithms are integrated into a workflow engine that allows financial analysts to design, test, and deploy multi-phase investment strategies with minimal delay. Our UI dashboard visualizes decision paths in entangled trees, revealing potential correlations and anomalies that classical models often overlook. We tested the model using synthetic data from five portfolio strategies ranging from ESG-compliant assets to crypto derivatives.
